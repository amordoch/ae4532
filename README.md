AE 4532 - Spacecraft Flight Dynamics Functions

These are MATLAB functions I made while taking AE 4532 (Spacecraft flight dynamics) at Georgia Tech.  
So far, the following subjects are covered:

- 2 body problem
  - Numerical solver
  - Solution of Kepler's equation
  - Ideal interplanetary transfers
- Rotation matrices
  - Creation from euler angles
  - Conversion to/from axis-angle representation and quaternions
  - Conversion to zxz, xyz euler angles
- Response to constant torque
  - Of angular velocity (also for time-dependent torque)
  - Of rotation matrices
  - Of xyz, zxz euler angles
- Misc
  - Databse of constants and orbital parameters for major solar system bodies
